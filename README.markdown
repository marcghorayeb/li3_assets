# li3_assets

JavaScript and CSS handling library for the [Lithium PHP Framework](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium). This library enables [less](http://lesscss.org/) css files to be compiled at run time by Lithium. CSS and Js files can also be combined into one (or multiple) files to better leverage client-side caching.

## Installation

## Thanks

This library is a fork from ifunk's github repository. Thank's to him for putting me on the right track with his library!

Thanks to the Lithium framework and to all of its contributors! Their framework is kind of the only reason I continue to use php today :)
